# DevOps

One of my professional passions is Devops and over the years I've started a collection of best practices or at least established patterns that work across what I do on the coding side of things

## Docs

- [Emojis](./docs/Emojis.md) that might be useful especially when building cli pipelines
- [Todo List](./docs/TODO.md)

## Azure DevOps

This folder contains samples of my Azure pipelines, mostly from my time at BestStart Educare Limited.

## Docker

This folder contains some of my compose files and useful containers around DevOps.

## Powershell

This folder contains a collection of useful Powershell scripts and modules I've developed over time.
There is a [Readme](./Powershell/README.md) with interesting tips and tricks.
